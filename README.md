# Practice website using React

I made this after watching [React Website Tutorial - Beginner React JS Project Fully Responsive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2UBjN5ER4s&t=23s) from Youtube.
Although I've only been exposed to React a few times, I've grown to like it, and I can see why so many web developers are using it now. 
First of all, React has simplicity and flexibility. When I built my first React website, I was amazed. It was so simple and easy to understand how to code. 
Sometimes I had to code by trial and error, which is really fun. Secondly, the components can be used repeatedly and do not need to be created over and over again. 
This is very helpful for us developers in web development and allows us to get things done quickly.
